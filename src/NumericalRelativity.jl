module NumericalRelativity

# Tensor
#
# (array of functions, coordinates, (indices up or down)) -> tensor
# T[-1,-1] means lower-lower indices and T[1,1] means up-up
# You should be able to find the Rank of tensors
# Contracting is possible? At least with a function contract
#
# Metric should be a rank two tensor
#
# partial gives back the symbols ∂T
# christoffel symbols should be (metric) -> christoffel
#
# Riemann Tensor g -> Riemann Tensor
# Ricci Tensor g -> Ricci Tensor
# Ricci Scalar g -> Ricci Scalar
